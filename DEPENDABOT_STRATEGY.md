# Elite Dependabot Workflow Strategy

This document outlines the automated dependency management strategy for **HealthBridge AI**.

## 1. Configuration Overview (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

We have implemented a **Grouped Update Strategy** to minimize noise and consolidate updates.

- **Schedule**: Weekly (Monday mornings)
- **Grouping**: All regular dependencies are grouped into single PRs per directory (Root & Frontend).
- **Limits**: Increased open PR limit to 10 to ensure nothing is missed.
- **Labels**: Automatically tags PRs with `dependencies`, `javascript`, and scope (`frontend`).

## 2. Directory Coverage

| Directory | Ecosystem | Strategy |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| `/` | npm | Root project dependencies |
| `/healthbridge-ai` | npm | Frontend application dependencies |

## 3. Workflow Checklist

### ✅ Weekly Routine
1.  **Monday Morning**: Dependabot opens consolidated PRs.
2.  **CI Checks**: GitHub Actions run `npm run build` and `npm test`.
3.  **Review**:
    -   Check the "Release Notes" link in the PR description.
    -   Verify the Compatibility Score.
    -   Since you are using detailed groups, you'll get one PR like "Bump npm dependencies from 16.x to 17.x".
4.  **Merge**: If CI passes and compatibility looks good, Squash & Merge.

### 🛡️ Security Alerts (Zero-Day)
- Dependabot Security Updates are **enabled by default** on public repositories (or enabled in Settings > Security for private).
- These bypass the weekly schedule and open immediately for Critical/High severity.

## 4. How to Handle the Current Situation

> **Context**: You currently have a PR for Next.js 16.1.5, but you verified you are locally on **16.1.6**.

**Action Plan:**
1.  Go to the Dependabot PR on GitHub.
2.  Comment: `@dependabot close` (or just close it manually).
3.  Reason: "Superseded by version 16.1.6".
4.  Push your local changes (which include the 16.1.6 lockfile) to `main`.
5.  Dependabot will re-scan and see you are up to date.
